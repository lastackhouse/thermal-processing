# Processing thermal imagery to extract temperature values
A repository for extracting temperature rasters from thermal imagery (specific to the DJI H20 series).

This repository hosts a workflow to convert raw thermal imagery from the Zenmuse H20T sensor to temperature rasters in a geotiff format. The code and workflow are based on work by Olivia Waite with the GenomeBC project, specifically from Chapter 14 of the GenomeBC Best Practices Guide. This version has been re-formatted for use specifically with stream surface temperature in freshwater systems.
